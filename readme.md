# A local library site

## Developed using nodejs(express) and inspired by MDN

I embarked on an epic quest to create a comprehensive local library website. Utilising node.js and leveraging the power of express.

During the quest, I drew inspiration and followed along the guidance of a great [MDN guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs).

The project has been a truly enriching experience from start to finish.

Throughout the development process, I was led to delve into the aspects of full-stack development, ranging from udnerstanding the significance of SOLID, towards manging HTTP calls to and from a web server, and handling the requests and responses to and from the database, and setting up the database itself thanks to the powerful cloud service of mongoDB atlas.

Furthermore, I also had a chance to dive into the curious syntax of pug, utilizing it's power to more easily generate the nessecary pages to present to the user.

For full disclosure it shoudl be said that the quest was no a solo expedition, but rather a guided exploration following the MDN guide. However it's worth mentioning that while the guide provided direction, it also highly encouraged independent problem-solving.

I truly enjoyed this type of learning as it gave me examples to go by, and threw me into solving similar problems myself.

While the end-goal was pre-defined, the valuable skills I gained from this project will undoubtedly accompany me on future endeavors.
